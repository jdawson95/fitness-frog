# ASP.NET MVC Fitness Frog

This project was built using a 253 minute course on <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com">Team Treehouse</a>. This course helps teach how to create forms using ASP.NET MVC. We used various field types and for validation as we built a web version of the Fitness Frog application using C#.
